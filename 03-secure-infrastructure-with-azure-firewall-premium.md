# Exercise 3: Secure Infrastructure with Azure Firewall Premium

### Estimated Duration: 120 Minutes

## Overview: 

Azure Firewall is a cloud-native and intelligent network firewall security service that provides the best-of-breed threat protection for your cloud workloads running in Azure. It's a fully stateful, firewall-as-a-service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. It provides both east-west and north-south traffic inspection.

Azure Firewall Premium is a next-generation firewall with capabilities that are required for highly sensitive and regulated environments. It includes the following features:

- **TLS Inspection:** decrypts outbound traffic, processes the data, then encrypts the data and sends it to the destination.
- **IDPS:** A network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) allows you to monitor network activities for malicious activity, log information about this activity, report it, and optionally attempt to block it.
- **URL filtering:** extends Azure Firewall’s FQDN filtering capability to consider an entire URL. For example, `www.contoso.com/a/c` instead of `www.contoso.com`.
- **Web categories:** Administrators can allow or deny user access to website categories such as gambling websites, social media websites, and others.
For more information, see `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/premium-features`

      >**Note:** This might take 5-6 minutes to update the firewall policy. Wait for the firewall policy to get updated before proceeding to the next steps.

      >**Note:** If the TLS deployment fails, please delete the **Managed Identity** and **Key Vault** from the resource group, then retry the deployment. What usually happens is that during deployment, the Key Vault and Managed Identity are created, and permissions are assigned to the Managed Identity. Occasionally, due to slight delays on Azure’s side, these permissions might take a little longer to apply, which can cause the deployment to fail. Retrying usually resolves the issue smoothly.

1. Perform these steps if TLS Inspection still fails after deleting the Managed Identity and Key Vault, if it succeeded, then proceed to step 17.
